							<h1>Youth Faculty 13: Academic Climate</h1>
							<h3>Under Youth Assembly 5: School Climate</h3>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/YF13_1.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<p>Hello everyone! We are Youth Faculty 13 â€” Locke, and our topic of discussion is Academic Climate. This refers to the academic environment comprising teaching and learning practices, stress levels and academic competition in schools. </p>
							<p>Due to an increasing focus on academic education in recent years, there are higher stress levels and unhealthy competition amongst students mainly caused by factors such as familial and peer pressure. A negative academic climate can potentially damage the psychological, mental and physical health of students. </p>
							<p>Some solutions we have identified as a team would include the removal of mid-year examinations, integrating more of the arts into school curriculum and incorporating technology into classrooms. </p>

							<h3>The Lens</h3>
							<p>Here is our Lens Video where we presented various aspects such as the causes, implications and solutions for academic climate through a news broadcast! </p>

							<h3>Exhibition</h3>
							<p>During the exhibition, we presented our research and knowledge on boards to help others better understand our topic and its significance </p>
							<p>(here we would include your exhibition boards, hopefully you left it in ops room)</p>
