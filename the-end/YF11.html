							<h1>Youth Faculty 11: Providing Education to the Impoverished</h1>
							<h3>Under Youth Assembly 4: Education in Developing Countries</h3>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic13.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<p>The issue allotted to YF11 was "Providing Education to the Impoverished". Being impoverished refers to living under poverty. The families living under poverty are unable to afford to send their children to school. Some parents' religious beliefs don't allow them to let their child get educated.</p>
							<p>Providing education, being such a large and global concern, had some serious problem attached to it.</p>
							<ol>
								<li>Children living under poverty are unable to afford education which makes it less likely for them to get a good job. If they don't get a job that pays them well then clearly their children would live in poverty too. This in turn creates a vicious cycle.</li>
								<li>Most children living in impoverished areas who don't go to school work as child labour. </li>
								<li>Some parents feel that school is a waste of time and teaches students useless things. This attitude results in parents not enrolling their children in schools and they in turn teach their children what skills they know. For example; a cobbler wouldn't send his son to school but instead teach him the skill of mending shoes so that he can take over his father's position when he retires.</li>
								<li>Children living in remote areas and war zones find it hard to get education due to there being no schools in their locality.</li>
							</ol>
							<p>The solutions we came up with are:</p>
							<ol>
								<li>Collaborations between NGOs and the government. The funding for schooling would be done by NGOs and government.</li>
								<li>Subsidised school fee. Since most families can't afford education, a reduction in school fees would gaurantee more children enrolled in schools.</li>
								<li>Spreading awareness through campaigns and workshops. Since some parents don't understand the importance of education, spreading awareness on this issue might help in changing their views.</li>
								<li>By introducing the concept of moving schools, the children living in remote areas and war zones would find it easier to get education. How this works is that teachers go to these areas to teach the children. This would result in the villagers gaining basic skills and the teachers can gain experience.</li>
							</ol>

							<h3>The Lens</h3>
							<p>Our Lens video was about a boy lived under poverty and worked as child labour. One fine day, after coming back from work, he asks his father if he can go to school. To this the father replies in negative stating that they could not afford him to go to school. Fat forward to 10 years later, he is walks past an electronics store where he sees a heated discussion going on between the government officials about education on the TV.</p>

							<p>The exhibition was a full success. It was real fun to go around visiting other people's stalls and learning what they had understood about the topic.</p>
							<p>(here we would include your exhibition boards, hopefully you left it in ops room)</p>
