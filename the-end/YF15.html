							<h1>Youth Faculty 15: Physical Climate</h1>
							<h3>Under Youth Assembly 5: School Climate</h3>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/YF15_1.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<p>Hi! We are Youth Faculty 15, and the issue that we are discussing is Physical Climate in schools/ education. The Physical climate of a school refers to the tangible aspects such as the layout, size, facilities and material or online resources that are available to teachers, administrators and students. </p>
							<p>It is important that this issue is brought up and discussed, as schools which lack a proper physical climate expose students to several problems. Firstly, a poor physical climate inhibits development of students, preventing them from reaching their full potential. This is because the students are restricted to basic educational facilities. This would lead to, in second, the students being psychologically affected by the abysmal learning environment. Thirdly, schools without proper physical climate lack readily accessible facilities. Students with differing needs and interests are thus neglected, and are unable to reach maximum development to pioneer change for the future.<br><br>
							Some of the issues which require tackling include: temperature of learning environment, availability of facilities, cleanliness, environmental sustainability, funding (for facilities and resources), noise, and class size. "</p>
							<p>Some of the solutions YF15 has come up with for this issue are:<br>
								<ol>
									<li>Student body forums. The forum will collate feedback and approach the school's management committee for approval to act upon the feedback. This allows for students to be more involved in the improvement of the school's physical environment and efficiently solve issues with the school while evaluating and discussing the problems with privacy such that no one student has the fear of exposure.</li>
									
									<li>Our next solution, to tackle the issue of noise pollution, would be to set up sound barriers and noise trackers. This is to ensure that students are studying in an acceptable environment by blocking out unnecessary sounds. </li>
									
									<li>This would be followed are Routine Checks. This would include checking of cleanliness/hygiene, noise levels and whatever else necessary (differs for each country). Checks would Ensure that noise levels do not hit a certain level. This allows for the Ministry to measure the effectiveness of the sound barriers on a constant basis. The Ministry should call upon for professional inspectors to assess the school cleanliness and sound barriers on a routine basis. This would allow for close monitoring and quick response where necessary, allowing for students to study in a clean and conducive environment. To monitor the schoolâ€™s cleanliness, monthly audits may be considered and consequently analysed from waste management authorities to provide the school with recommendation from which the physical environment can be improved. </li>
									
									<li>On top of that, The fourth solution is the Class Duty Roster. We would like to adopt the style of Japan, where cleanliness is of utmost importance and is the first priority. We would like the students of the class to take initiative and clean their own classrooms. The students should be responsible for maintaining the clean learning environment that they study in. This duty roster can start from primary school all the way up to the last year of schooling. This initiative makes students responsible and also keeps the classroom clean. This also helps invoke good cleaning habits from a very young age. </li>
								</ol></p>
							<h3>The Lens</h3>
							<p>Our video shows the consequences of lack of cleanliness and facilities in schools. It also demonstrates the unwise utility of resources from the government. It also considers the positive impacts of our mentioned solutions.Link to slides: <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1kqy7U6r58z08IYqK-ZPsvUcFAQKk8iDjaoAa9MzWVCI">here</a></p>

							<h3>Exhibition</h3>
							<p>Our plan was to consolidate the ideas from our presentation and lens and refine them with the comments from the judges and delegates from other YFs. Preparation time was limited but we managed to work it out despite facing challenges on board design and content. The content of our exhibition boards are as follows:</p>
							<ol>
								<li>Brief introduction and context of topic</li>
								<li>Impacts</li>
								<li>Solutions</li>
								<li>Case studies</li>
							</ol>
							<p>(here we would include your exhibition boards, hopefully you left it in ops room)</p>

							<h3>THANK YOU!!</h3>
							<p>It was a fruitful learning experience to share ideas and opinions on the concept of "physical climate". We have gained a deeper understanding on how this topic is relevant to us as students and how education plays an important role in this. It has been a great convention for us!! skux!</p>
