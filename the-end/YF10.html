							<h1>Youth Faculty 10: Social Cohesion</h1>
							<h3>Under Youth Assembly 4: Education in Developing Countries</h3>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic13.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<p>Throughout the past 3 days, YF10 has gone through fruitful discussions on the topic of education in remote and war torn areas. Remote areas refers to geographically hazardous areas that are not easily accessible and often far from urban areas and isolated. On the other hand, war-torn areas are places destroyed by war and where war is taking place or it recently took place. Pertaining to the contentious issue of remote areas, inaccessibility often leads to students being unable to be educated as it is very difficult to build schools in remote areas because of the uneven terrain, leading to a lack of educational and public facilities, and a lack of certified teachers. In regards to war torn areas, long drawn conflicts worsened by historical animosities have shown to tear down society and result in not only poverty, but also psychological fear and trauma which hinders the promotion of education in these communities. The government prioritises necessities and more resources are pumped into other sectors for warfare rather than for the funding of schools, teachers and materials, instead being utilised for warfare expenditure such as ammunitions and weapons.</p>
							<p>
								One of the main issues are that there would be less societal development due to lack of resources that impedes the economic and societal development.<br>
								Children are victims of abuse and trauma and all these contribute to the impacts on their health when they grow up.<br>
								In addition, low literacy rates and absence of teaching materials directly give rise to lack in training of the 21st Century skills, such as not being tech saavy.<br>
								Workforce is therefore not attractive to foreign investors due to low skills, globally less competitive. The lack of education compels the impoverished to commit crimes and succumb to stealing, robbing and taking down the wrong path. As children lack proper moral education and may not receive good parenting, this increases crime rates in the area, ultimately leading to social fragmentation and distrust amongst one another in the community.<br>
							</p>
							<p>Some solutions are through various stakeholders such as NGOs and local non-profit organisations. For instance, A teacher a day keeps terror away gets teachers to come down weekly to teach students so NGOs can ensure a safe space and volunteers to administer training to teachers and education to students. Mobile libraries and utilising technology (tablets) can enhance accessibility of education to children in the community and improve their learning experience. Children can experience 3D learning and better visualise concepts and they don't have to face the dangers of travelling through geographically dangerous areas.</p>

							<h3>The Lens</h3>
							<p>The Lens Video reflects an impression of how students in war-torn areas survive where education is extremely inaccessible, the problems they face and how we plan to solve them through injections of humour and a degree of formality.</p>
