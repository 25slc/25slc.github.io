							<h1>Youth Faculty 7: Applied Learning</h1>
							<h3>Under Youth Assembly 3: Holistic Education</h3>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/YF7_1.jpeg" alt="" /></span>
							<p>Hello we are youth faculty 7 and the topic we were working on is applied learning!Applied learning refers to an educational approach where students learn by engaging in direct application of skills, theories and models. The applied learning activity can occur outside of the traditional classroom experience and/or be embedded as part of a course.</p>
							<p>Some problems are: </p>
							<ol>
								<li>Takes attention away from national examinations/learning fundamental knowledge</li>
								<li>Lack of resources in developing countries</li>
								<li>Problems regarding the grading system:</li>
								<li>It would be difficult to grade students fairly</li>
								<li>Standardisation of teaching is required</li>
								<li>Problems regarding people’s mindsets: </li>
								<li>Students do not see the importance of applied learning</li>
							</ol>
							  
							<p>Some solutions are:</p>
							<ol>
								<li>Start with a new batch of students. (And for the current batch..) Use applied learning in increasing amounts, starting from preschool and working up to higher levels of education. </li>
								(parental solutions)
								<li>Use applied learning in increasing amounts, starting from preschool and working up to higher levels of education. </li>
								<li>Use both applied learning and conventional learning styles in conjunction</li>
								<li>Include applied learning questions in exams</li>
								<li>Value based applied learning - in preschools/lower primary</li>
								<li>Knowledge based applied learning - secondary schools all the way to undergrads</li>
								<li>The level of understanding should be increased and the questions should be asked on the concepts</li>
								<li>The way of marking should be subjective and should not be strictly restricted to the textbook.</li>
							</ol>
							<h3>The Lens</h3>
							<p>Our lens video is about how a boy Timothy learns physics through playing basketball and how he’s apposed by his parents and his teacher at first and how they understand what applied learning is!</p>

							<p>(here we would include your exhibition boards, hopefully you left it in ops room)</p>

							<h3>Thank you!</h3>
							<p>Remember us as the yf with the most hearts!❤️We may not have won anything but we got those unnumbered moments with each other that were full of fun and laughter!Also we were the ones doing the flagella!</p>
