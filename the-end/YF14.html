							<h1>Youth Faculty 14: Safety</h1>
							<h3>Under Youth Assembly 5: School Climate</h3>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/YF14_1.JPG" alt="" /></span>
							<p>Hello, We are Youth Faculty 14, and the issue we are discussing is Safety in School Climate. School climate refers to the quality of school life. It is important to have a safe school climate for students to study in, as it allows students to be in a more conducive environment that promotes social and creative learning and they would be confident and feel safe in their school environment, making it like their second home. </p>
							<p>Threats to Safety in School Climate are categorised into two aspects, Physical and Mental. Physical threats include school shootings unsafe infrastructure (labarotories, rooms), unpreparedness in times of crisis (lack of planning of fire and lockdown drills), and terrorist attacks (Beslan school siege). Mental threats include bullying (Verbal Bullying, Cyber Bullying), stress (stress-induced self-harm, examinations, suicidal thoughts), communications & relations with schools/ teachers (The use of tone and language) and stigmatisation (Elite schools vs Neighbourhood Schools, Streaming, Different family backgrounds)</p>
							<p>We have decided to focus on Bullying, and it is defined as an act of repeated aggression with intentions to hurt another person, physically or mentally. It can also be characterized as an individual behaving in a certain way to gain power over another person. Bullying is further broken down into three forms: physical, mental and cyber (as we recognise that in the 21st century, with the advent of technology, acts of bullying can take place online as well). </p>

							<h3>The Lens</h3>
							<p>Here is our Lens video, which describes how disastrous and devastating the various impacts of bullying can be on the victims, but also show how some problem can be alleviated. For example, bystanders can help, which is also what our solutions target.</p>

							<h3>Exhibition</h3>
							<p>Our exhibition displays our process from discovering our topic, to developing our solutions and coming up with our final product.</p>
							<p>(here we would include your exhibition boards, hopefully you left it in ops room)</p>

							<h3>Thank you </h3>
							<p>to yf14, thank you for giving me such a wonderful experience in slc!! my main objective of this convention was to learn how to bond with people i'm not close to, and that made me afraid as i don't usually get in conversations with these unfamiliar people. however, the connection and click was found after the 2nd day of slc, and we were all getting comfortable in a mere 2 days! this is evidence of how great our yf is, each and every one of us are different but we never let these differences separate us, but instead, we share these incredible and inspiring personal stories that allow us to understand each other and hence, bond so well :-) these new friendships forged would never be written off, and i trust that we'll somehow all meet again! thank you, yf 14 :"")<br>
									- Joyce (participant) <br><br>
									
									Stepping into my first SLC, I was worried about whether I would be able to bond with my YF well, but YF 14 has been nothing short of amazing. I cannot further express how proud I am of all of you guys for winning the Best Youth Faculty Award. Thank you for being such a pleasant and wonderful group of people to work with. Thank you for being so nice and understanding despite all our shortcomings. To see all of you so bonded and close by the end of SLC, Iâ€™m just so glad and happy. Although those 4 days of SLC were super short, I will never forget the wonderful and magical memories each and every one of you have created for me. Really missing you guys so much & hope to meet all of you once again! <br>
