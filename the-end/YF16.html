							<h1>Youth Faculty 16: Effect of Censorship in Education</h1>
							<h3>Under Youth Assembly 6: National Education</h3>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/YF16_1.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<p>Hello there, we are Youth Faculty 16 and the issue that we will be discussing about today is the Effects of Censorship in Education. What is censorship to begin with, the denotation for censorship is... </p>
							<p>Some of the negatives of censorship in education are that it would narrow down the perspectives of people</p>
							<p>Some of the positives of censorship in education is that it would limit the age limit for the students to learn something that is inappropriate for their age</p>

							<h3>The Lens</h3>
							<p>Here is our Lens Video, we used it to show an example of censorship in education and we hope that you would enjoy the video as much as we made it. </p>
